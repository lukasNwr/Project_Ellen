# Project Ellen

> Project Ellen was a school project aimed mainly at developing OOP skills using Java programming language. The course spanned one semester and there were multiple variations of the final projects developed along the way.

## Project goal
Project Goal
This project was made as assignment for one of my classes while I was in school. The class focused on object-oriented programming and this assignment was supposed to test the knowledge that we have learned throughout the course. The project focuses on implementation of some key features of OOP such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation, design patternsâ€¦ The result was supposed to be one fully playable game level that is finishable and contains multiple different types of enemies, interactive elements, some progress features and of course ability to successfully finish the level with some action.

## Thought process and challenges
The game was developed on top of a GameLib library using Java language. The decision to use Java was made by school but it allowed me to utilize full power of object oriented programming, since Java supports all of the core principles of OOP. The key point of this project was to learn basics of OOP, therefore the whole architecture of the project follows this mindset. In the project, I have used multiple design patterns such as Facade, Memento, Prototype and others.

While I was developing this project, I also tried my best to comply with the main rules of OOP, meaning using data encapsulation, class hierarchy, interfaces, composition and polymorphism. I also strived to use as least member variables as I could with useful and understandable APIs in form of public methods.

Since this project was relatively big and my knowledge of OOP at that time was pretty much non existent, I was struggling mainly with successful implementation the design patterns and concepts such as polymorphism in practical form. That being said, I am confident, that by completing this project I have learned a lot about OOP and its principles and I enjoyed working on it a lot, because, hey, working on a game is always fun right?
